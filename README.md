About two weeks ago, my girlfriend introduced me to a game on iOS called "Cat Game." It's a simple and relaxing game where you build furnitures, collect cats, level up, unlock new homes, build more furnitures, and collect more cats. The main bottleneck of this game is the "coin," which is the in-game currency required to do much of the initial work to eventually collect the cats. One of the ways to earn "coins" is by completing daily tasks, which are obviously time-gated. Fortunately, an infinite source of "coins" can be obtained from the mini games page. One of them is a 1010!-esque game which I tried but am not very good at. So, this project is my ace; I may not be the best at 1010, but this model sure will be.
